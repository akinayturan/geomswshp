                        <p><strong>As an organizing commitee, we are honored to invite you to attend the International Symposium for 1.GEOCHRONOLOGY AND MASS SPECTROMETRY WORKSHOP 2022 which will be
                                held on 5-6 May 2022 online. This workshop will useful for scientists, students, and researchers who are interested in studies such as the events from the formation of
                                the universe to the present, the dating of the magmatism and volcanic activities, time scales of magmatic processes, the effect of humanity and volcanism, and the
                                revealing of the magmatism-tectonism relationship. In this workshop, the methods used for geochronological studies and case studies will be explained and
                                discussed.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Through the workshop, it will be possible to establish new partnerships, to share knowledge and experiences.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>The purpose of the workshop is to give information about the geological, petrological and geochronological information to participants. Also, this workshop aims to
                                provide connections for students and young reserachers, and also to provide opportunities for experts to share and discuss their experiences.</strong></p>
